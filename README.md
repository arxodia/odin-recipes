# odin-recipes
This project was created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. 
Its purpose is to practice the basic HTML skills I have learned up to this point,
including linking between pages, displaying images, and modifying text displayed through
various formatting such as lists, headers, and emphasis elements.

Credit for the images and the listed lasagna recipe is provided below, as well as on the respective pages:
